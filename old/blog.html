            <h3><u>YOLO - Some meaningful insight...</u></h3>
            <p>"I wish my stove came with a Save As button like Word has.
                That way I could experiment with my cooking and not fear
                ruining my dinner." - Jarod Kintz</p>

            <p>I believe in redefining the way people do everyday tasks.
                Forget creating crazy, wacky new technology that will extend our horizons.
                <b>No, I want to solve all the smaller problems we
                face everyday but are too lazy to tackle.</b> That way, life
                becomes something exciting to wake up to. We live one day
                without knowledge of what will happen the next - so why waste
                today dreaming about tomorrow? To all of you I say #YOLO.
                Let's change Today.</p><br>

            <h3><u>Failure</u></h3>
            <p>"There's a way to do it better - find it."
                - Thomas Edison</p>

            <p>I create innovative solutions to everyday problems in
                creative, novel ways. Innovation is having the courage to
                sacrifice the comfortable, reliable norm to start all over
                again. <b>Failure isn't a possibility; it is an expectation.</b>
                I embrace failure as a breadcrumb on the trail to success.
                And so we have the startling reality of innovation: Today's
                success is tomorrow's failure. So it goes.</p>
